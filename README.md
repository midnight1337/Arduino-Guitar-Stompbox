# arduino_guitar_pedal
Digital guitar pedal based on Atmega328P chip.
Project made for graduating my University of Science and Technology in 2022, During this project I was able to connect together my passions: electric guitar and science. I increased my skills and knowledge in programming, electrical engineering, and the physics of electrical audio signal. I had to understood, what is audio signal, how analog audio signal behaves in a circuit, and how does a CPU can sample, process, and output that signal.
