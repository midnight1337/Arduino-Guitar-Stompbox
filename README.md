# arduino_guitar_pedal
Digital guitar pedal based on Atmega328P chip.
This is my final project made for graduating University of Science and Technology in 31-01-2022, During this project I was able to connect together some hobbies I'm into: playing electric guitar, programming and science. I increased my skills and knowledge in programming, electrical engineering, and the physics of electrical audio signal. I had to understandd, what is audio signal, how to create filters components in a circuit - how to calculate their parameters and how they behave with each other, how analog audio signal behaves in a circuit, and how does a CPU can sample, process, and output that signal.
